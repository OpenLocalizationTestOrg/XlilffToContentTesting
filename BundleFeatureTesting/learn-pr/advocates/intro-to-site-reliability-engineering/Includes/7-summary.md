Welcome to the world of site reliability engineering! Hopefully this module has given you a good start in your understanding of SRE. Together we've covered some of its key principles and practices and placed it in the appropriate context. Weâ€™ve talked about how you might begin to go deeper into the topic yourself and explore it in your workplace. We hope you'll join us for future modules on the topic.
