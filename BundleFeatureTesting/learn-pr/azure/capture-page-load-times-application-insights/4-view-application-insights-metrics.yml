    - content: In the Application Insights dashboard.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: The Application Insights dashboard is used only to display an analysis of telemetry data. The web app sends telemetry data to the Application Insights resource, where it's stored.
  - content: You create a custom chart and pin it to an Application Insights dashboard. Other users of the dashboard can't see the new chart. What should you do to resolve the problem?
    choices:
    - content: Re-publish the Application Insights dashboard.

    - content: Choose a different aggregation method in the chart.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: You can use an aggregation method to control how data is summarized in the chart, but the chart won't be visible to other users until you re-publish it.
