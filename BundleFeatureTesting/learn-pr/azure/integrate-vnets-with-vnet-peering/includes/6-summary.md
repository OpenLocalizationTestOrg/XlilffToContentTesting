In this module, you learned how to use peering to connect virtual networks in a hub and spoke topology. You used VMs and SSH to verify connectivity between virtual networks. The peering connections will enable communication for services that run on the VMs.

Now that you understand how to peer virtual networks together, you can use this cost-effective and minimally complex method in your Azure network infrastructure. The method enables low-latency communication between resources in virtual networks. It supports scenarios where resources are in different regions or subscriptions. Virtual network peering should be your first choice when you need to connect virtual networks.
