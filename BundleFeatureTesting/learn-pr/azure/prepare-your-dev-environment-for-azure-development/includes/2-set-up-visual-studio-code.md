Visual Studio Code is a popular choice for developing applications for Azure. It's lightweight, taking up only megabytes of storage space, and works on Windows, Linux, and macOS.

## <a name="visual-studio-code"></a>Visual Studio Code

Visual Studio Code is a free source code editor developed by Microsoft. It supports hundreds of programming languages, includes Git integration, and is designed to connect to Azure cloud services.

However, it doesn't include a compiler. Code compilation for specific languages and scenarios is added via extensions.

## <a name="extension-model"></a>Extension model

One of the most powerful features of Visual Studio Code is the extension model. Extensions _extend_ the capabilities of Visual Studio Code to add a wide range of new capabilities. For example, extensions can be used to add compilers, add spell checking, and integrate with Azure services.

Extensions are free and can be added from the Extensions page within Visual Studio Code. You can explore the available extensions in the [Visual Studio Code Marketplace](https://marketplace.visualstudio.com/).

Many of the extensions target Azure features and products. This includes features such as Docker support, subscription management, tooling for the Azure CLI, database access, and Azure Storage API integration.
