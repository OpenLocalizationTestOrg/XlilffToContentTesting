In this module, you have learned how to create a custom Logic Apps connector. To connect Logic Apps to a custom REST API, describe that API by supplying a definition in OpenAPI format or a Postman collection. Then you can call functions in that API from Actions in any Logic App.

Now that youâ€™ve created the connector, you can also use it to connect Microsoft Flow and PowerApps to your REST API.
