When you're ready to swap two slots, make sure you've applied the correct configuration to the swapped slots.

Suppose you've finished testing version 2 of your social media web app. Now you want to deploy that version to production. You want to further streamline deployment by automatically swapping future versions of the app.

Here you'll learn how to swap manually and automatically.

## <a name="configure-a-slot-setting"></a>Configure a slot setting

Before you deploy version 2 of the web app, configure a slot setting. The settings you'll configure here won't affect your demo app. The purpose of this exercise is just to see how the configurations work when you swap slots.

To configure slot settings:

1. Go to the **Overview** page of the production slot's web app.
1. Select the **Application Settings** page for the deployment slot.
1. Scroll down to **Application settings** and then select **Add new setting**.
1. Under **App setting name**, enter **ENVIRONMENT_NAME**. Under **Value**, enter **production**. Under **Slot**, select the check box to make this a slot setting.
1. Add another setting called **APP_VERSION**, and enter the value **1**. Don't make this a slot setting.
1. Near the top of the page, select the **Save** button.
1. Repeat the preceding steps on the staging slot's web app. Use the following settings:

    | Name             | Value   | Slot |
    |------------------|---------|------|
    | ENVIRONMENT_NAME | staging | Yes  |
    | APP_VERSION      | 2       | $12  |

## <a name="swap-the-slots"></a>Swap the slots

Now that you've tested version 2 of the web app in the staging slot, you can deploy it by swapping the slots. Follow these steps:

1. To make sure you're configuring the production slot, select **All resources** and then select the production slot's web app.
1. Under **Deployment**, select **Deployment slots** > **Swap**.

1. Make sure you're about to swap the staging and production slots. Notice how the swap will affect settings. The value of the APP_VERSION setting will be exchanged between the slots, but the value of the ENVIRONMENT slot setting won't be swapped. Select **Swap**.

    ![Complete a swap](../media/5-simple-swap.png)

1. When the swap is complete, go to the **Overview** page of the production slot's web app and select **Browse**. The web app appears on a new browser tab. Notice that version 2 of the web app is now in production.
1. Close the browser tab.

## <a name="configure-auto-swap-for-the-staging-slot"></a>Configure auto swap for the staging slot

Suppose that now that you're using deployment slots, you want to enable continuous deployment. You'll do this by using the auto swap feature for your web app. In a system that uses auto swap, when you deploy new code to the staging slot, Azure automatically warms it up and deploys it to production by swapping the staging and production slots. To configure auto swap, follow these steps:

1. Go to the **Application settings** page of the staging slot's web app.
1. In **General settings**, next to **Auto Swap**, select **On**.
1. In the **Auto Swap Slot** list, select **production**. Then select **Save**.

    ![Configure auto swap](../media/5-configure-auto-swap.png)

## <a name="deploy-new-code-and-auto-swap-it-into-production"></a>Deploy new code and auto swap it into production

Now you'll modify the code to create version 3 of the web app. When you deploy it to the staging slot, you'll see auto swap in action. Follow these steps:

1. On the right side of the Cloud Shell window, restart the editor if it's not already running.

    ```bash
    code .
    ```

1. In the code editor, in the **File list** on the left, expand **aspnet-get-started** > **Views** > **Home**. Then select **Index.cshtml**.
1. Locate the following code:

    ```html
    <h1>Web App Version 2</h1>
    ```

1. Replace that code with this code:

    ```html
    <h1>Web App Version 3</h1>
    ```

1. To save your changes, press CTRL+S.
1. In Cloud Shell, enter the following commands. Enter your password when you're prompted.

    ```bash
    git add .
    git commit -m "Third version of web app."
    git push staging
    ```

    Wait for the deployment to finish. Near the end of the text output, you'll see a message that indicates that the deployment has requested an auto swap to the production slot.

1. In the Azure portal, go to the **Overview** page for the production slot's web app and select **Browse**. The third version of the web app appears on a new browser tab. The push to the staging slot triggered an automatic swap with the production slot.

## <a name="roll-back-the-new-version"></a>Roll back the new version

Suppose that deploying version 3 of your app to production revealed an unexpected problem. To quickly resolve it, you can roll back to the previous version of the site by swapping the slots again.

1. Go to the **Deployment slots** page of the production slot's web app. 
1. Swap the staging and production slots. 
1. When the swap finishes, on the **Overview** page, select the **Browse** button to view the app one last time. You'll see that version 2 has been redeployed to production.
