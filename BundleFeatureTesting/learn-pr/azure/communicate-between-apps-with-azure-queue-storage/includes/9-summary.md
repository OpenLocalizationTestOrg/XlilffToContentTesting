In this module, you've seen how queues in Azure storage accounts are used to pass messages between components in a distributed application. Using queues in this way can help to make a distributed application more reliable and resilient to failures and periods of high demand. If you use the Microsoft Azure Storage Client Library for .NET, you can easily write C# or VB.NET code that creates queues, adds messages, or retrieves and removes messages from queues.
