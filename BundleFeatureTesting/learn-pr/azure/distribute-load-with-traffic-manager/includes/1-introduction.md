Suppose you're the lead architect for a company providing a global music streaming web application. You want your customers, wherever they are in the world, to experience near zero downtime. The application should be responsive because you know poor performance may drive customers to your competitors. You'd also like to have customized experiences to customers in specific regions, for user interface, legal, and operational reasons.
