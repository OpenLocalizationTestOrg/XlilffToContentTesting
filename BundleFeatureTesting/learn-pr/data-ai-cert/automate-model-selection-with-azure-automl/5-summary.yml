quiz:
  title: Check your knowledge
  questions:
  - content: Which step below is not part of using AutoML?
    choices:
    - content: Define the machine learning objective and constraints.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This is correct. Hyperparameters control how the model training executes and must be set before model training.
    - content: Launch the AutoML process.
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is not correct. Hyperparameters cannot be determined from the source data.
    - content: Deploy the model.
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: This is not correct.  A Hyperparameter is set before each model training execution.
  - content: Which service below is not included as part of AutoML?
    choices:
    - content: Data preparation
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That is correct.  Data preparation should be done prior to using AutoML.
    - content: Machine learning model recommendation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is not correct.  AutoML supports automation evaluation of models and recommendation of the best one to use.
    - content: Hyperparameter tuning
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is correct.  AutoML supports automatics hyperparameter tuning which is covered in detail in another module.
  - content: One of the AutoMLConfig settings is primary_metric.  Which of the following values is not a valid value for this setting?
    choices:
    - content: bayesian_correlation
      isCorrect: true
      explanation: That is correct.  bayesian_correlation is not a valid value.
    - content: normalized_root_mean_squared_error
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is not correct.  normalized_root_mean_squared_error is a valid value.
    - content: spearman_correlation
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: That is not correct.  spearman_correlation is a valid value.
