We've covered quite a bit of information about face recognition and emotion. You can use the testing web interface to learn how the calls to the API work. Also consider using a client application to work through the concepts. Try this [C# tutorial with a sample starter application](https://docs.microsoft.com/azure/cognitive-services/computer-vision/tutorials/csharptutorial).

Face detection is just one part of the overall Vision API in Azure Cognitive Services. Use it in your applications to take advantage of the facial recognition capabilities that Microsoft provides. If the built-in functionality doesn't match your needs completely, use data science to create your own facial recognition services, or use the custom vision capabilities.
