One of the primary tasks a data scientist undertakes is to build predictive models from a dataset. These models can then be incorporated into a workstream to make cost predictions, forecast changes, or analyze event patterns to find discrepancies. Azure Machine Learning service provides a set of SDKs and cloud services to help with the various steps of preparing data and building a model. 

With Azure Machine Learning service, you can implement key services to scale data wrangling, model training, model evaluation, deployment, and model management, which vastly improves your ability to deliver solutions.
