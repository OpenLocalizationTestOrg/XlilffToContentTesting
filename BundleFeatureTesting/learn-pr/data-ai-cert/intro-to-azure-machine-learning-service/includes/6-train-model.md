Let's create a new workspace and experiment. You can quickly set up a workspace by using the Azure portal or via Python code. We'll go through each approach here.

## <a name="create-a-workspace-by-using-the-azure-portal"></a>Create a workspace by using the Azure portal

Follow these steps to create a workspace in the Azure portal.

1. Sign in to the [Azure portal](https://portal.azure.com?azure-portal=true]) using your Azure subscription.

1. In the Search box at the top of the portal, type **machine learning service workspaces**. 

1. Select the "Machine Learning Service Workspaces" option under SERVICES.

    ![The screenshot depicts Machine Learning service workspaces being selected in the search box results.](../media/6-select-ml-service-workspace.png)

1. Select **Add** at the top left of the Machine Learning service workspaces pane, and then enter the necessary information to create the workspace.

    | Field | Description |
    |-------|-------------|
    | Workspace name | Enter a unique name for your workspace. In this example, you use **docs-ws**. The names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that is easy to remember and different from workspaces that others create. |
    | Subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. |
    | Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A *resource group* is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, you use **docs-aml**. |
    | Location | Select the location closest to your users and the data resources. This location is where the workspace is created. |
    
    ![The screenshot depicts the required information for creating a Machine Learning service workspace, which includes boxes for Workspace name, Subscription, Resource group, and Location.](../media/6-create-ml-service-workspace.png)
    

1. In the newly created workspace, select **Open Azure Notebooks** to create the first experiment.

1. Sign in with the same Microsoft account you used to create the workspace in the Azure portal.

1. After you sign in, a new tab opens and a "Clone Library" prompt appears. Select **Clone**, and then run the notebook.

1. Along with two notebooks, you will see a **Config.json** file. This configuration file contains information about the workspace that you created.

1. Select **01.run-experiment.ipynb** to open the notebook.

1. Run the cells one at a time (<kbd>Shift</kbd>+<kbd>Enter</kbd>) or select **Cells** > **Run All** to run the entire notebook. When you see an asterisk (*) next to a cell, it's running. After the code for that cell finishes, a number appears.

1. After running all the cells in the notebook, you can view the logged values in your workspace.

1. Browse back to the portal page, select **View Experiments**, and then select **my-first-experiment** to see the model run report.

## <a name="create-a-workspace-by-using-python"></a>Create a workspace by using Python

To create a workspace by using Python:

1. Install a Python environment like Anaconda, Miniconda, or Python virtual environment.

1. Create an isolated Python environment.

1. In a command-line or terminal window, create a new Conda environment named **myenv** with Python 3.6:

    ```bash
    # Create
    conda create -n myenv -y Python=3.6
    # Activate
    conda activate myenv
    ```
    
1. Install the SDK.

1. Install the core components of the Machine Learning SDK and Jupyter Notebook server with the following code:

    ```bash
    # Install Jupyter
    conda install nb_conda
    
    # Install the base SDK and Jupyter Notebook
    pip install azureml-sdk[notebooks]
    ```
    
1. Start Jupyter Notebook:

    ```bash
    # Launch
    jupyter notebook
    ```
    
1. In your browser, create a new notebook, choose the `Python 3` kernel, and then sign in to the Azure portal if necessary.

1. Run the following Python code replacing each of the `{placeholder}`s with the proper values for your subscription.

    ```python
    import azureml.core
    print(azureml.core.VERSION)
    
    from azureml.core import Workspace
    ws = Workspace.create(name='myworkspace',
                subscription_id='{azure-subscription-id}', 
                resource_group='{resource-group-name}',
                create_resource_group = True,
                location='{location}'
                )
    ```
    
    |    Field    |    Description    |
    |    -----    |    -----------    |
    | Workspace name | Enter a unique name for your workspace. In this example, you use **docs-ws**. The names must be unique across the resource group. Use a name that is easy to remember and different from workspaces that others create. |
    | Subscription | Select the Azure subscription that you want to use. |
    | Resource group | Use an existing resource group in your subscription or enter a name to create a new resource group. A *resource group* is a container that holds related resources for an Azure solution. In this example, you use **docs-aml**. |
    | Location | Select the location closest to your users and the data resources. This location is where the workspace is created. |
    
1. To view workspace details such as associated storage, container registry, and key vault, use the following code:

    ```python
    ws.get_details()
    ```
    
1. Write a configuration file.

    Details of your workspace must be saved to a configuration JSON file in the current directory. The `write_config()` application programming interface (API) call creates the configuration file in the current directory. The **config.json** file contains the following:

    ```json
    {
        "subscription_id": "{azure-subscription-id}",
        "resource_group": "{resource-group-name}",
        "workspace_name": "myworkspace"
    }
    ```
    
1. The following code will create the configuration file:

    ```python
    # Create the configuration file.
    ws.write_config()
    ```
    
1. Use the workspace:

    ```python
    from azureml.core import Experiment
    
    # create an experiment
    exp = Experiment(workspace=ws, name='trial_exp')
    
    # start a run
    run = exp.start_logging()
    
    # log a number
    run.log('trail', 30)
    
    # log a list (Fibonacci numbers)
    run.log_list('my list', [1, 1, 2, 3, 5, 8, 13, 21, 34, 55]) 
    
    # finish the run
    run.complete()
    ```
    
1. View the logged results:

    ```python
    print(run.get_portal_url())
    ```
    
    The link directs you to logged values in the Azure portal.

1. Clean up the resources:

    ```python
    ws.delete(delete_dependent_resources=True)
    ```
