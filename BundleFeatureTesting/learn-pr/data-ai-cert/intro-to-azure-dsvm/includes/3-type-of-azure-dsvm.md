Each type of DSVM is designed to support different types of machine learning, for example general predictive modeling, deep learning, and geospatial AI.

Currently there are two different types of Azure DSVM: Windows DSVMs and Linux DSVMs. Azure offers a Windows Server 2016 and Windows Server 2012 version. Linux DSVMs offer Ubuntu 16.04 LTS and CentOS 7.4 versions.

Deep learning is a popular approach when trying to tackle questions involving neural networks with large datasets. Deep learning requires specific tools to manage requirements for the problem at hand. The Deep Learning DSVM comes preconfigured and preinstalled with many of these tools. 

Training deep learning models is computationally intense. For better model training performance select a high-speed GPU-based machine, which will significantly speed up machine model training.

The DSVM has analytic capabilities optimized for geospatial and location data. It has the ArcGIS Pro geographic information system integrated into the VM to support advanced geographic-based AI questions. It also has other conventional data science tools preconfigured and preinstalled for ease-of-use.
