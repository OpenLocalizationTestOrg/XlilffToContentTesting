## <a name="clean-up"></a>Clean up

The sandbox will clean up your resources automatically when you're finished with this module.

When you're working in your own subscription, it's a best practice at the end of a project to identify whether you still need the resources you created. Resources left running can cost you money. You can delete resources one by one or just delete the resource group to get rid of the entire set.
