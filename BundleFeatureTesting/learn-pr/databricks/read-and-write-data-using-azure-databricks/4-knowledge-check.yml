  - content: How do you create a DataFrame object?
    choices:
    - content: Introduce a variable name and equate it to something like myDataFrameDF =.
      explanation: Correct. This approach is the correct way to create DataFrame objects.
      isCorrect: true

      explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
  - content: What is the Python syntax for defining a DataFrame in Spark from an existing Parquet file in DBFS?
    choices:
    - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.read.parquet("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
      explanation: This syntax is correct.
      isCorrect: true
    - content: IPGeocodeDF = parquet.read("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
      isCorrect: false
      explanation: This syntax is incorrect.
    - content: IPGeocodeDF = spark.parquet.read("dbfs:/mnt/training/ip-geocode.parquet")
