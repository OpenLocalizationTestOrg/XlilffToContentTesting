Exploratory data analysis (EDA) is the process of analyzing a dataset to find anomalies and missing information. By using EDA, you can get a generic view of the dataset without any preconceived assumptions.

The focus of EDA is answering the following questions about a dataset:

- What type of data is in the dataset, and what's its structure?
- Is there missing or incomplete information?
- Are there are mistakes or anomalies?
- What are the relationships between different variables?
- How will different assumptions work against the available dataset?
