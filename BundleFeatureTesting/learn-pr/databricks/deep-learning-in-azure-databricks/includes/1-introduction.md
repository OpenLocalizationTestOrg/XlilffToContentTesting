Deep learning is a subset of machine learning that uses algorithms based on the structure and functions of the human brain. These algorithms are called artificial neural networks, and they learn from large amounts of data. Artificial neural networks include several deep layers that enable them to solve problems that require human-like thought processes.

Deep-learning techniques have the following advantages:

- **Accuracy:** Deep neural networks produce highly accurate results in some of the most complex situations, such as image classification.
- **Scalability:** Deep-learning methods work efficiently on large volumes of data and are scalable based on the dataset.
- **Robustness:** Artificial neural networks can work directly on a raw dataset without requiring any cleanup or engineering.
- **Adaptability:** Pretrained deep neural networks can be easily transferred and used with varied domains.
