The first step to using Azure Databricks is to create and deploy a Databricks workspace. You can do this in the Azure portal.

## <a name="deploy-an-azure-databricks-workspace"></a>Deploy an Azure Databricks workspace

1. Click the following link to open the Azure Resource Manager template in the Azure portal: [Deploy Databricks from the Azure Resource Manager Template](https://portal.azure.com/#create/Microsoft.Template/uri/https%3A%2F%2Fraw.githubusercontent.com%2FAzure%2Fazure-quickstart-templates%2Fmaster%2F101-databricks-workspace%2Fazuredeploy.json)

1. Provide the required values to create your Azure Databricks workspace:

   - **Subscription**: Choose the Azure subscription in which to deploy the workspace.
   - **Resource Group**: Use **Create new** and provide a name for the new resource group.
   - **Location**: Select a location near you for deployment. For the list of regions that are supported by Azure Databricks, see [Azure services available by region](https://azure.microsoft.com/regions/services/).
   - **Workspace Name**: Provide a name for your workspace.
   - **Pricing Tier**: Select **premium**.

1. Accept the terms and conditions.
1. Select **Purchase**.

The workspace creation takes a few minutes. During workspace creation, the **Submitting deployment for Azure Databricks** tile appears on the right side of the portal. You might need to scroll right on your dashboard to see the tile. There's also a progress bar displayed near the top of the screen. You can watch either area for progress.
